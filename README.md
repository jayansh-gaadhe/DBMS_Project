# üìä DBMS Project ‚Äì Database Design and Implementation

This repository contains a comprehensive database management system (DBMS) project, demonstrating the entire process of designing, normalizing, implementing, and querying a relational database system.

---

## üß† Project Overview

This project follows a structured approach to database design, covering:

- Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling
- Identification and minimization of Functional Dependencies
- Schema normalization up to Boyce‚ÄìCodd Normal Form (BCNF)
- SQL-based implementation of schema and data
- Execution of complex SQL queries to validate database functionality

## üìÅ Repository Structure

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `ER Diagram.jpg` | Visual representation of the ER model, outlining entities, attributes, and relationships. |
| `Minimal FD set.pdf` | List of functional dependencies derived from the ER model and reduced to a minimal set. |
| `BCNF Proofs.pdf` | Step-by-step normalization process with decomposition of relations into BCNF. |
| `Relational Schema.jpg` | Diagram of the final relational schema post-normalization. |
